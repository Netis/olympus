"""Unit test for run_triage.sh's comment composition — stdlib only, so CI can
run it without installing anything:

    python3 scripts/agent-bot/tests/test_triage.py

run_triage.sh's live flow needs `gh`, `claude`, and the network. The part worth
testing in isolation is `compose_comment_body` — which exact markdown gets
posted for each verdict. The script supports `TRIAGE_LIB_ONLY=1`: sourced that
way it loads the helpers and returns BEFORE the live flow, so we can drive the
pure function directly.

What's under test (the behavior the maintainer asked for):
  - the warm, agent-authored `reply` is posted verbatim, NOT a robotic
    "Triage: <verdict>" template, and with no gate-number checklist;
  - a non-`do` verdict still gets the reply, plus collapsed maintainer controls;
  - a `do`→`needs_info` safety downgrade drops the (now-misleading) `do` reply
    for an honest fallback;
  - the hidden breadcrumb marker matches the verdict.

Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure.
