# Shared helper: poll LiteLLM until it answers /v1/models with the
# configured API key, with exponential backoff. Source from any
# agent script that's about to invoke `claude --print` (or any
# OpenAI-compatible client) — the helper makes the agent tolerant of
# LiteLLM / model backend restarts that happen DURING a workflow's queue
# time. Without it, a transient backend hiccup causes the run to
# exit immediately and the work (and 15-min queue wait, on a busy
# self-hosted runner) is wasted.
#
# Usage:
#   source "$REPO_ROOT/scripts/lib/litellm-wait.sh"
#   wait_for_litellm || exit $?
#   claude --print ...
#
# Required env:
#   ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL  full URL (no trailing slash) — e.g.,
#                       http://litellm-host:4000
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY   bearer token; never printed; used only in
#                       the Authorization header for the probe.
#
# Optional env:
#   MAX_LITELLM_WAIT_SECONDS  total budget before giving up. Default
#                              1800 (30 min). Workflow timeouts are
#                              120-360 min so the budget fits.
#
# Output:
#   On success (LiteLLM reachable): no output unless the helper had
#   to wait, in which case a single "litellm available again after
#   <N>s wait" line goes to stderr.
#   On waiting: one ::warning:: line per retry, with elapsed +
#   next backoff. No secret values ever printed.
#   On total failure: one ::error:: line and return code 2.
#
# Why the helper polls /v1/models specifically: it's a cheap GET
# that exercises auth (bearer-token check on the proxy) without
# burning model tokens. A 200 response means "LiteLLM is up AND our
# key is accepted" — both preconditions for the upcoming agent run.

# Inner probe — returns:
#   0     2xx (LiteLLM up AND key accepted)
#   1     4xx (LiteLLM up, auth rejected — don't wait, fail fast)
#   2     other status (5xx, connect refused, timeout) — retry

# Returns 0 (true) when the LiteLLM endpoint looks DOWN right now

# serving any response — 2xx OR 4xx. The 4xx case is deliberately
# treated as "not down": LiteLLM is up and choosing to reject; that
# is a configuration issue, not a transient outage to wait through.
#
# Designed to be called immediately after a `claude --print` failure
# to decide whether to retry. Pattern in the agent scripts:
#
#   while true; do
#       claude --print ...  ; rc=$?
#       [ $rc -eq 0 ] && break
#       litellm_appears_down || break   # not down → real failure

#       attempt=$((attempt+1))
#       wait_for_litellm || break        # wait for recovery
#   done
#
# CLAUDE_RETRY_MAX is per-caller; default 2 in the agent scripts
# (giving 3 attempts total). The retry restarts claude from scratch
# — for stateful agents (wiwi) any work already committed to the
# branch is preserved by virtue of being on disk; in-flight, not-yet
# -committed work is lost. That's an acceptable trade because the
# alternative (no retry) loses the whole run anyway.
