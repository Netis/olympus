# Sensitive-information leakage linter.
#
# A public repo must never carry internal-infra identity: private IPs,
# plaintext credentials, or private-key material. This linter is the
# deterministic gate behind CLAUDE.md's PR-hygiene rule — it fails CI
# on any tracked file that leaks one of the classes below.
#
# Detected classes (high-confidence, near-zero false positive):
#
#   1. Private / internal IPv4 addresses (RFC1918 + CGNAT) that are NOT
#      on the safe allow-list in scripts/lint/leakage-allowlist.txt.
#      Real infra hosts trip this; documentation ranges (RFC5737),
#      loopback, and the docker0 default do not.
#   2. Private-key PEM blocks (`-----BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY-----`).
#   3. Machine-specific home-directory paths with real usernames:
#      `/home/<name>/` or `/Users/<name>/` where `<name>` is a concrete
#      user (not a placeholder like `<user>`, `$HOME`, `~`, etc.).
#      Wire-data fixtures in tests/fixtures and docs/examples may
#      legitimately contain captured paths from other machines and are
#      excluded via the file-pattern allowlist.
#
# Out of scope (left to the human/agent reviewer's semantic pass —
# regex can't separate these from legitimate prose):
#   * Plaintext passwords, internal hostnames.
#   The PR-review agent prompt carries a leakage dimension for those.
#
# Scope: tracked text files only (git ls-files; binary files skipped via
# grep -I), minus vendored trees, build output, historical design docs,
# the changelog, and lockfiles. Test fixtures ARE scanned — recorded
# wire data must still not carry real internal IPs (use RFC5737 ranges);
# only true binaries (.pcap etc.) fall out via the binary-file skip.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/lint/check-leakage.sh
